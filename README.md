# Huffman_Coding
Simple file compression tool using Huffman Coding.

# How to use
To use this tool, just call its executable (Huffman.exe) on the terminal passing one file as argument.
If the file passed as argument is a zipped file (created by this program with an ".hzip" extension), then the program will 
decompress it. Otherwise, the program will compress it.
The compressed/decompressed file will be created in the same directory as the original file (passed as input by the user).
Even though the program can decompress files of different formats, to guarantee its optimal functioning, the input file is 
expected to be a text file in ASCII or UTF-8 formats.
